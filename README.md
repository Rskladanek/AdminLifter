# AdminLifter - README

## üìå Overview
**AdminLifter** is a Windows-based tool designed for **privilege escalation**. It leverages service functionalities and VBScript execution to demonstrate security techniques and explore potential vulnerabilities.

> **Note:** This project has reached its final stage of development and is no longer actively maintained.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility
- **Windows 11**: The `runasinvoker` bypass no longer works reliably on Windows 11. It may only function for **specific executables** (e.g., those without a manifest enforcing admin privileges).
- **Older Windows Versions (Windows 7, 8, 10)**: The bypass typically works as expected.

---

## üöß Project Status
This project is **completed**. No further updates or new features are planned.  
- Tested successfully on older Windows versions.  
- Limited functionality on Windows 11 due to stricter UAC and manifest rules.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Batch File (`bypass.bat`):**
- Allows running programs that request admin privileges **without** triggering a UAC prompt (on supported Windows versions).
- **Usage:** Drag and drop an executable onto `bypass.bat`.  
- **Important:** On Windows 11, this bypass only works for select executables that do not have an embedded `requireAdministrator` manifest.

```batch
:: Bypass script for older Windows versions (runasinvoker trick)
cmd /min /C "set __COMPAT_LAYER=runasinvoker && start "" "%1""
```

## 2. VBScript (`bhservice_task.vbs`)

Collects system information and appends it to `C:\Windows\TEMP\bhpoutput.txt`.

**Features:**
- Gathers OS, memory, hardware, and BIOS data via WMI.
- Intended for demonstration and testing of system info retrieval.

## 3. Python Service (`main.py` + `blackhatService.py`)

Implements a Windows service in Python using `pywin32`.

**Workflow:**
1. Copies `bhservice_task.vbs` to `C:\Windows\TEMP`.
2. Executes the script via `cscript.exe`.
3. Removes the script after execution to keep the system clean.

### Key Steps:
1. Copies `bhservice_task.vbs` to `C:\Windows\TEMP`.
2. Executes it with `cscript.exe`.
3. Deletes the script after execution.

## üìù Requirements
- **Python 3.x**  
- `pywin32` library (install with `pip install pywin32`)

### Additional Setup
- Place the VBScript in the `modules/` directory.
- Run the Python service with administrator privileges.

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Privilege Bypass (Older Windows)**  
   - Drag and drop an executable onto `bypass.bat`.  
   - If the executable does **not** have a strict admin manifest, it will open without the usual UAC prompt (on older systems).

2. **System Information Gathering**  
   - Use `main.py install` to register the Python service, then `main.py start` to launch it.  
   - The service will periodically collect system information via `bhservice_task.vbs`.

**Stopping & Removing the Service**
```bash
python main.py stop
python main.py remove
```
